        Sedt is  a  text  editor  for  the IBM PC and compatibles
running DOS  Microsoft Windows,  OS/2,  DEC  Rainbow,  ATARI  ST,
VAX/VMS, VAX/ULTRIX, RISC/ULTRIX,  SCO  System  V, and SCO XENIX.
Sources may be licensed for porting to other systems.  Porting to
other UNIX implementations is usually trivial.

        Sedt  is  a  shareware  program and may only be  used  by
properly  licensed  users.    See  the  file  LICENSE.TXT for the
license agreement.  The license fee includes ONE of the following
packages.  Further  updates  and additional packages will only be
made upon payment of the proper distribution fee.

        Please  note that  I  now  ship  3.5  inch  high  density

        size make sure to request it.

each of  package  (A, B, C, D, E or F) ordered.  One package will
be $25, two $35, three $45, four $55, and five $65.

I do issue site licenses on request for porting to other systems.
Please write me  a  letter  indicating your reasonf for needing a
source license.  I  will return you a license agreement which you
will need to fill out, sign and return to me before I will mail a
set of sources.  I will also  quote you a price for the kit which
will be in line with the binary licensing fees.

        Site licenses.   For  a  given number of employees, using
any systems at the site,  does not cover non site relevant use of
Sedt by employees.  Site license  includes  free  distribution of
one kit.  Site licenses only apply to one  geographical site of a
company or non-profit institution.  Fee is dependent on number of
employees using Sedt:

        Number of employees     Fee

        1-5                     $25 per employee
        6-10                    $125
        11-50                   $200
        50-200                  $500
        201-1000                $1000

        Educational  licenses.    There  is  no license  fee  for
instructional, class-room use.  Site license fees apply  to other
uses by educational institutions.

        For orders placed outside the U.S.   I appreciate payment
in U.S.  funds payable by a  U.S.  bank.  Checks not payable to a
U.S.  bank involve hefty charges.

        I continuously  fix  problems  that I am aware of and add
new features.   At any time an order comes in, I ship the current
the version I am  working on.  If, for some reason, you find that
the software I shipped you  has  a  serious problem, I'll be more
than happy to fix the problem,  if I haven't done so already, and
ship you  a  replacement.    Also, if you intend to put Sedt on a
bulletin board, please do so only after testing it thoroughly, or
get in contact with me.

        Sedt is what it  is  because  of  a  continuing,  intense
dialog with the user base.    If  you  have  any  suggestions for
improvement, I am anxious to hear about  it.    Please  mail your
thoughts to me at my home address.   8  Middlemost  Way, Stow, MA
01775.  I would appreciate your cooperation in limiting telephone
queries to an absolute minimum.

        For installation instructions  read  INSTALL.HOW  on  the
installation  disk  and  for    complete    documentation    read
SEDTMAN.EDT.

        Please  avoid  contacting    me    at  Digital  Equipment
Corporation unless the issue  you  want  to discuss is related to
business with Digital.  You  can  reach  me  my  electronic  mail
through Compuserve as "72337,3211".  You can  reach  this account
from  Internet   as  "72337.3211%compuserve.com@CS.RELAY.NET"  or

I hope you will enjoy the product.
