				Sedt Version 4.0
						
			    Author: Anker Berg-Sonne
						
				   Description	
						
		Sedt  is  a  screen  editor  written  with  the  goal  of
	providing  a  common  editor  across  a  wide range of	operating
	systems.    For  ease-of-use  Sedt  is programmed with a keyboard
	layout similar to EDT.

		For a  complete  description  of Sedt's features read the
	documentation in SEDTMAN.EDT.

		Sedt version 4.0  (151)  and  higher  edit  numbers  is a
	shareware program and must  be	properly  licensed  by	paying	a
	license fee.

		Properly  licensed  users will receive	support  if  they
	submit a report in writing to  the  author,  Anker  Berg-Sonne, 8
	Middlemost Way, Stow, MA 01775, U.S.A.



			       Distribution Policy

		You  may distribute Sedt freely by any means as  long  as
	the  License  Agreement  and  all  other  files from the original
	distribution are included.

		Sedt  may  not	be  used  beyond a one month trial period
	without payment of a license fee.
        
		The  license  fee  includes  ONE  copy of  Sedt  for  ONE
	operating system.  Additional copies and updates require  payment
	of a fee.
	
		Sedt is currently available in the following versions:
	
			MS-DOS for Rainbow 100
			MS-DOS for VAXmate
			MS-DOS for IBM PC/XT/AT and compatibles
			MS-DOS for PS/2 and compatibles
			MS-DOS Microsoft Windows for IBM PC/AT and compatibles
			OS/2 protected mode
			ATARI ST 
			VAX/VMS
			VAX ULTRIX
			SCO XENIX
			SCO UNIX


				   Installation

		Each installation kit  contains a file named INSTALL.HOW.
	This text file contains the installtion instructions for the kit.


				 Known Problems

		Under MS/DOS you may  run  out of files when using 3 to 4
	concurrent buffers.  You should increase the number of concurrent
	files in CONFIG.SYS to at least  12.	The  symptom  is either a
	fatal  message "Error creating buffer file" or	non-fatal  "Could
	not open journal file" or "Could not open input file".

		When on the MS/DOS versions the column number exceeds 64K
	the  display will become corrupted and Sedt may not  be  able  to
	recover.  There are no plans to correct this problem.

                Incorporate a number of changes made by Rudolf Sedlaczek
                        from Technical University Vienna
                        
    13-NOV-1991	VMS-version:
      -	Don't set terminal to pasthru (in qio.mar) to enable Ctrl/C, Ctrl/Y and
	Ctrl/T again as in former versions. 
	These keys can therefore not be defined as SEDT keys.
      -	Allow logical names for function definitions, keyboard maps, help file, 
      	keyboard diagrams, configuration and initialization file.
	SEDT now first looks for these logicals before trying to open
	the files in the current directory, SEDT$DIR and SEDT$LIBRARY
	All logicals are built by replacing the . by $
	The benefits are to have to maintain only one keyboard diagram file
	and one keyboard map file for up to 4 different terminal-types or
	be able to edit a file in a directory containing these files.
	For EDT Mapping, following logicals apply: 
	FUNDEF$EDT VT100M$EDT VT200M$EDT VT300M$EDT VT400M$EDT HELP$EDT 	
	VT100H$EDT VT200H$EDT VT300H$EDT VT400H$EDT SEDT$CNF SEDTCOM$TXT

    27-NOV-1991 all versions
      -	fix bug in :NWC
      - On :UOFF or :RF do not repaint windows on buffer stack if current 
      	window is zoomed (avoids multiple flushing of hidden windows to 
	the screen)
        else if current window is not zoomed and in case of zoomed windows 
	in the buffer stack start repainting of all windows at the zoomed
	window, not at the beginning of the buffer stack.
      - change status line to appear only once for any counts of windows.
	Multiple lines with the same information or multiple first halfs of
	the status line (in case of vertically splitted windows) makes no
	sense.
      - Show filename on window border if this border is in the upper half 
      	of the screen and if the window is not the current window.
      - Lower left corner  of  window  border  was  displaced 1 column to 
	the left.
      - Change :SASC to sho current column and ASCII value (only VMS, UNIX)
    11-DEC-1991
      - Help System enhancements:
        Allow F12 in help to function as Backspace (There is no Backspace 
      	key on a VT200 keyboard)
        Allow Keypad keys 0 to 9 besides numeric keys 0 to 9 to select 
      	menus in help.
	Prev Screen or Cursor Up redisplay first page of multiscreen help 
	topics, Next Screen and Cursor Down act like Return.
      - Add mouse support for terminals with ANSI locator support 
        (e.g. DECterm, VWS terminal-emulator on VAXstations: VT200, VT300, 
	VT400. Mouse is disabled if Device-Type is VT100) for VMS.
	Mouse is enabled by default.
	Add following new mouse features:
	- Clicking on the string B=n in the top status line cycles to the 
	  next used buffer.
	- Clicking on the string Mod=n in the bottom status line cycles to 
	  the next modified buffer.
	- Clicking on the Character M in the right corner of the top 
	  status line displays the next broadcast message.
	- Disable mouse during prompts, repeat-count entry, learn and help.
          To disable mouse permanently add MOUSE=DISABLED to SEDT.CNF;
          To disable mouse temporarily enter learn mode;
	  To disable mouse for one command (e.g. local cut/paste) enter Gold 1.
	- Restrict recognized mouse events outside the edit window to left
	  button down clicks.
	- Allow multiple resizing of windows with mouse without 
	  disturbing screen refreshs.
    	ANSI locator input are escape sequences embedded
	in the normal keyboard input stream. Corresponding keyboard mappings
	and function definitions must exist for the mouse to function properly.
	These consistent definitions are only included in the FUNDEF.INP and
	VT200M.INP files!
      - Fix Bug in MAPKEY to be able to compile key sequences with more
      	than 8 characters, for VMS allow at least CTRL/C and CTRL/Y to exit.
     3-JAN-1992
      - Define characters `~[{]}\| as input string terminators in qio.mar
        and corresponding functions definitions and keyboard mappings. This 
        fixes an old VMS-specific behaviour, where normal typewriter keys
        where incorrectly echoed (by the multiple character read qio with
        echo) when these keys were redefined (e.g. as German Umlaut) and the
        cursor was positioned at end of line. This was also necessary for the
        proper function of the new style commands starting with `, as the
        menu was sometimes not immediatly displayed due to the same reason. 
      - Add some new style menu commands to EDT mapping.
      - Add new command :RI (Reposition Input stream one character) for 
        internal use, corresponding function definition and keyboard mapping
        to allow pending new style menu commands to be cancelled by an
        escape- sequence (any keypad or function key). This sequence is no
        longer inserted into the buffer, but executed normally.
     3-FEB-1992
      - Add new command :CNV (CouNter absolute Value) to convert the current 
        value of a counter to its absolute value. This is needed for the 
        indentation functions (Gold Left/Right Arrow) to prevent a syntax
        error when the current direction is reverse.
      - Add mouse support for terminals with ANSI locator for CONVEX and SUN.
	Include appropriate definitions in FUNDEF.INP and DEFM.INP files.
     16-MAR-1992
      - Enable mouse support for terminals with ANSI locator for all UNIX 
	systems.
