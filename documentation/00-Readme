DOS = original documentation from seddos and sedsrc 
      (but not the HELP file that sedt loads, that is in mapfiles.etc)
      
linux = original documentation from linux.tar
      (but not the HELP file that sedt loads, that is in mapfiles.etc)

same = Files the same in both distributions, and sedt.doc was similar enough 
       to select the most up to date.  As it turns out, these files all came 
       from the DOS directory (even though it is the linux source code that 
       appeared to be more up to date.)
