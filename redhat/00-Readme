The linuxFC4 zip file in this directory contains the files that converted 
the original linux distro into the version I used on FC4.

MOST OF THIS IS ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE SOURCE CODE in the directory above 
this.

The patch also modifies the linux build/make file to include the additional
mouse options (GPM and xterm).  That part has not been applied in this source
yet, so you would have to do that yourself.  Presumably you copy the linux
build file to the main source dir and run the patch, but I haven't done that 
yet to test it.  (If I had then I would not bother putting this file here.)

ALSO the patch also modifies a keymap and fundef file to incorporate the 
xterm mouse functions.  Again, you probably need to copy the appropriate
mapfile.etc files to the source dir and run the patch to fix them, and
again, this is something I have not yet done with this set of source
code.
